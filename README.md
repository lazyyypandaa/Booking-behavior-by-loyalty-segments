# Booking-behavior-by-loyalty-segments

## RFV (Recency, Frequency, Value) Analysis ‚Äì Travel Booking Data

This project aims to segment customers of a travel company using RFV (Recency, Frequency, Value) analysis. It provides data-driven insights into customer loyalty, engagement, and re-engagement opportunities using SQL for data processing and Power BI for visualization.

## Project Overview

Travel companies often struggle to identify which customers are most valuable or in need of re-engagement. This project analyzes historical booking data to categorize customers based on their travel behavior, allowing stakeholders to:

- Identify loyal customers
- Spot lapsing users
- Uncover seasonal travel patterns
- Optimize marketing and retention strategies

## Tech Stack

- **SQL**: Data extraction and segmentation
- **Power BI**: Data visualization and dashboard creation
- **Data Source**: Simulated travel booking dataset

## Key SQL Insights

### Segmentation Queries

- **Active Loyal**: Customers with ‚â•3 bookings, including at least one in the last 3 years.
- **Lapsed Loyal**: Customers with ‚â•3 bookings, but no bookings in the past 3 years.
- **Active Repeaters**: 1‚Äì2 bookings, most recent within 3 years.
- **Lapsing**: 1‚Äì2 bookings, most recent 3‚Äì5 years ago.
- **Lapsed**: 1‚Äì2 bookings, last booking over 5 years ago.

### Behavioral Insights

- **Travel Lag**: Calculates % of customers who travel within 30 days of booking.
- **Booking Interval**: Computes days between bookings for each customer to identify re-engagement windows.

## Power BI Dashboard Highlights

- **RFV KPI's**: Cards are showing proportions of loyal, repeat, and lapsed customers.
- **Booking Trends Over Time**: Seasonal analysis of booking activity.
- **Booking vs Travel Gap**: Distribution of how soon customers travel after booking.
